## Tales of cheap duckies: combining Digispark Attiny85, TOR and the Empire Framework, by W1ckDavid

Programmable MCUs (acronym for Micro Controller Units) have limitless possibilities.
These boards can be programmed to emulate USB devices and automatically mimic human interaction: the so called ‘rubber duckies’ are the swiss-knife for all ethical hackers, PenTesters and cyber security enthusiasts into Physical Hacking. 
The potential of such devices will be the core of this talk. 
Starting from a real story of programming, testing and curiosity, the true power of rubber duckies will be unlocked in a practical study case. This scenario, presented in a live demo, will show how to code, deploy and execute anonymous reverse shells through the use of Digispark Attiny85, TOR and the Empire Framework.
